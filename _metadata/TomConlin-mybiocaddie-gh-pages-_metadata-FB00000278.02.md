 This dataset includes the results of RNA-Seq analysis in E13.5 mouse palates. The downloadable Excel file includes for each gene: -- gene: official mouse gene symbol -- gene length (bp, exons only) -- RPKM (Reads per kb / million reads) in two replicate samples To download the data, log in and click on the &quot;Download dataset&quot; button. In addition to the tabulated Excel format, the same data can also be viewed as genome-wide coverage maps on the FaceBase Genome Browser mirror
