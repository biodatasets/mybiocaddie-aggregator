 The data preparation protocols for this study are described here See Genome Browser Track Enhancer location: Mouse genome mm9, chr5:20455843-20456804; Name: mCF76; Vista Enhancer ID: mm390; Nearest craniofacial gene or locus: none; Enhancer expression: negative; This data set includes the following: -- Apdf file that summarizes the whole-mount data for the tested element. This file includes light microscopy whole-mount images of the LacZ reporter gene expression in mouse embryos, a summary of the annotation of the expression pattern, the DNA sequence of the tested element in Fasta format, and the sequences of the primers used to generate the test construct.
