 This dataset includes the results of ChIP-Seq analysis of p300 bound regions in E15.5 mouse palates. The results are also presented as tracks on the Genome Browser The data include the following information for each peak called: -- ranking. Called peaks are ranked by maximum coverage, those with equal maximum coverage are then ranked by local p-value. -- the location of the peak, shown as chromosome start and end positions (mouse genome build mm9) -- peak length -- position of the peak summit -- tags: the number of reads in peaks (# reads in region, not maximum read coverage depth) -- score: -(log(pvalue)) -- fold enrichment: enrichment in peak vs input sample -- FDR: false-discovery rate annotation based on post-peak calling filtering of peaks based on genome annotation To download the data, log in and click on the &quot;Download dataset&quot; button.
