 The data preparation protocols for this study are described here. See Genome Browser Track>; Enhancer location: Mouse genome mm9, chr15:62734249-62735453; Name: mCF143; Vista Enhancer ID: mm457; Nearest craniofacial gene or locus: 8q24; Enhancer expression: Negative; This data set includes the following: -- Apdf file that summarizes the whole-mount data for the tested element. This file includes light microscopy whole-mount images of the LacZ reporter gene expression in mouse embryos, a summary of the annotation of the expression pattern, the DNA sequence of the tested element in Fasta format, and the sequences of the primers used to generate the test construct.To see this information in the Vista Enhancer Browser at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, click here. -- Tested element.txt: A text file that includes information about the location, the proximal gene, and the tissues where the enhancer is active, if any, as stated above.
